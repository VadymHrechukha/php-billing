In general the billing functions like this:

For a given [order] a [calculator] finds [plan]s and then matches
applicable [price]s to [action]s and calculates [charge]s.
Then [charge]s can be aggregated to [bill]s with [aggregator].

Billing operates such ideas:

- [Action] - [customer]'s metered activity of a certain [type] at a certain [target]
- [Order] - collection of [action]s
- [Bill]
- [Charge]
- [Plan]
- [Price]
- [Customer]
- [Sale] - a subscription, binding [customer] to a [target] and a [plan]
- [Target] - object being charged in billing
- [Type]
- [Calculator]
- [Aggregator]
